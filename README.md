Upon a player dieing, they will loose half of there balance.  

## Normal Installation (Non-Developer) 

You can download the latest version of the plugin from [the releases tab on github](https://github.com/RyanMoodGAMING/HalfCoins/releases).  

This plugin requires [Vault](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault) to be used on your server.  
You must have an existing economy plugin on your server such as [EssentialsX](https://essentialsx.net/).  

## Developer Controbrution

I request that developers contact via a ticket in my [discord](https://discord.gg/T2qKspyxGR) before submitting a Pull Request with any changes. This is for the following reasons:
 1. I know what has been added and you can go into detail on what the feature does.
 2. I know that it is coming from a trustworthy person.
 3. I can add you to the controbution list via your [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/) or [Mc-Market](https://mc-market.org/) name.
